  Project Name   : SMART HUT FOR STRAY ANIMALS

  // ****************************************************************************************************************************
  Purpose : To develop a device that can solve the problem of environmental damage and starvation of stray animals.
  // ****************************************************************************************************************************
  System Input  : 
                  1)HC SR-04 : To measure the distance stray animals and food containers.
  
  System Output :
                  1) SG90 RC Mini : to give rotational motion to food containers.
  // ****************************************************************************************************************************  
  System Work :  When the HC SR04 distance sensor detects a living thing, it directs a command to the SG90 RC mini servo motor, 
                allowing the SG90 RC mini servo motor to actuate the food tubes.
